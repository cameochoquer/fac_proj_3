# Comment Box
The comment box page is the third project in the Founder & Coders application process.

## Description
This page is a form that must collect name, email, and comment from the user. Once submitted the comments (and all following comments) should show up on the page. 

## Planning

1. create html skeleton
2. create css skeleton
3. learn about forms and inputs
4. learn about strings and arrays
5. create a countcharacter function 
6. create function to add new elements to html 


## How it was built

Building did somehwat followed planning. 
First iteraction had no feedback for user to see if they had added too many characters. 
Second iteration included function to continually add comments but had no styling which made it difficult to read
Third iteraction put into flexbox so it felt/looked more appealing on mobile
Fourth iteration adding if/else to validate form entry 
Fifth iteraction added darkmode

## Future Improvements <sub><sub> or what I would've done with more time </sub></sub>
- rewrite function to create an array of ojbects for each comment submission/input
- add further form validation 
- create cleaner layout similar to a sign in page with clear right and left sections but still display comments below (eg. [like this one](https://app.beapplied.com/dashboard/#/login?path=undefined))
- more styling for the submitted comments (eg. creating separate div instead of list)
